# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

## Timeline/Checklist

### Planning & Research
- Choose your challenge: dance, drawing, or maze navigation
- Explore the Finch API documentation
- Review sample programs from BirdBrain Technologies
- Create a project plan with pseudocode/flow charts/
- Clone and set up GitHub repository for your project

### Development
- Write initial code implementation
- Test basic functionality with the Finch robot
- Debug and refine your approach
- Document your progress and challenges

### Implementation & Testing
- Complete core functionality implementation
- Conduct thorough testing with the robot
- Optimize code for readability and efficiency
- Start preparing documentation

### Finalization
- Finalize code and ensure complete functionality
- Complete README documentation
- Prepare for demonstration
- Submit final project to GitHub

### Deployment
- Demonstrate your project

## Required Components

### Technical Requirements
Your program must include at least 5 of these Java/OOP concepts:
- Inheritance/Subclasses
- Method overloading or overriding
- Arrays or ArrayLists
- Loops (for, while, etc.)
- Conditional statements
- Exception handling
- File I/O for configuration or logging
- Constants and static methods
- User input processing

### Documentation Requirements
- Well-commented code with appropriate Javadoc
- GitHub repository with organized file structure
- README.md file including:
  * Project description and objectives
  * Description of design choices
  * Challenges faced and solutions
  * Future enhancements
  * Video or images of your robot in action (embedded or linked)

## Project Rubric (16 points total)

| Category | 4 Points | 3 Points | 2 Points | 1 Point |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Program Functionality** | Program fully accomplishes the chosen challenge with additional creative features. Robot behavior is refined, reliable, and impressive. | Program successfully completes the chosen challenge with minor limitations. Robot behavior is consistent and functional. | Program partially completes the challenge with some inconsistencies. Robot behavior has notable limitations. | Program fails to achieve the core objectives of the challenge. |
| **Code Quality & OOP Implementation** | Code demonstrates excellent OOP design with 6+ APCSA concepts implemented effectively. Code is elegant, efficient, and well-structured. | Code uses good OOP practices with 5 APCSA concepts implemented correctly. Code is readable and organized. | Code implements basic OOP structure with minimum required APCSA concepts. Some organizational issues present. | Code lacks proper OOP implementation or has significant structural problems. |
| **Documentation & GitHub Repository** | Exceptional documentation with comprehensive README, well-commented code, and excellent repository organization. | Complete documentation with clear README, adequately commented code, and organized repository. | Basic documentation with minimal README, some comments, and basic repository structure. | Insufficient documentation or poorly organized repository. |
| **Development & Version Control** | The repository demonstrates excellent use of Git and GitHub by having many commits and updates to one or more branches of the repository | The repository shows great use of Git and GitHub by having more than 2 new commits to the repository | The repository demonstrates basic used of Git and GitHub by having at least 1 new commit to a branch of the repository | The repository only have the initial clone of the or no project submitted |

## Challenge-Specific Guidelines

### Dance Challenge this is the one that I used
Create a choreographed dance routine for your Finch that synchronizes:
- Movement patterns (forward/backward, turns)
- LED light displays (beak and tail)
- Sound patterns using the buzzer
- Consider using arrays to store sequences of movements/lights/sounds

## Resources
- Finch API Documentation (provided in class)
- [BirdBrain Technologies Learning Resources](https://learn.birdbraintechnologies.com/finch/java/program/)
- [Java API Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/index.html)

## Extension Opportunities
If you complete your chosen challenge early, consider:
- Adding sensor-responsive behaviors to your program
- Creating a user interface to control robot parameters (JFrame, Swing, JavaFX)
- Implementing multiple modes of operation
- Adding an obstacle detection and avoidance system

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
## The project that me and cara did focused on making the finch robot do a dance. We also made it light up and play a little tune at the end. The design choices that I used were lights that were green, red, blue, white, and pink/ Some challenges that we faced while coding was figuring ou thow to push my repositiory to github, we also had a problem with connecting and saving my work on VS code, since it is a website that we never used before. The solutions that we used for this was to ask my peers and Mr Eillo. Some future enhancements for this project would be to make the movement a little faster, and make it do a flip off of a ramp. Here is the video of my finch in action!!!!!!!!!
